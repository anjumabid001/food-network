            <h2 class="gray">Importance of Healthy Foods</h2>
            <p>Healthy food is also needed for the functioning of our system. All the nutrients derived from healthy
                food trigger body cells and brain cells to actively run and perform their task.
                Healthy food improves the immune system, preventing you from falling sick easily. A strong immunity
                fights against all disease bearing bacteria and viruses.

        <p>
            Some of the healthy foods are given below.

            <h2>Butternut Squash Chilli and Coconut Soup</h2>
            <p>This dish is perfect for the cooler weather months. A comforting heartwarming soup with a small kick of
                cayenne pepper for a little added heat. Butternut squash is an abundant source of powerful antioxidants,
                including vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. Antioxidants help prevent or slow cellular damage and
                reduce inflammation, which may reduce your risk of several chronic diseases. Coconuts and their milk
                contain a lipid called lauric acid, and many researchers believe that lauric acid can support.</p>

            <h2>Beef Steak</h2>
            <p>Steak is one of the best protein sources, and protein is important for pretty much every cell in your
                body. Protein is essential for keeping our hair, nails, skin, bones, cartilage and blood in good shape.
                Steak is one of the best sources of iron, making it a great food choice for those who are likely
                to suffer from anemia. Scientists have also done studies that suggest iron deficiencies are less likely
                to be found in people who eat red meat, poultry and fish regularly. Apart from protein and iron, steak
                is incredibly rich in other nutrients that our
                bodies need to function, like carnosine and creatine. </p>

            <h2>Mixed Fruit Salad</h2>
            <p>Fruits consist of water and fibre, ensuring low-calorie intake and high energy levels that will aid in
                weight loss. For example, kiwi has high fibre and low calories, ideal for weight management. Fruits rich
                in vitamin C such as kiwi or strawberry help with the growth and repair of tissues in the body and, the
                fiber content is known to improve bowel function, which prevents constipation and can even help with
                asthma. A fruit salad, packing a high dose of fibre works brilliantly for digestion. Fruits such as
                oranges and bananas contain less fructose, making them easier to tolerate and less likely to cause gas.
